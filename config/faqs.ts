    content:
      "A landing page is a standalone web page created specifically for a marketing or advertising campaign. It's where a visitor 'lands' after they click on a link in an email, or ads from Google, Bing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or similar places on the web. Unlike web pages, which typically have many goals and encourage exploration, landing pages are designed with a single focus or goal, known as a call to action (CTA).",
